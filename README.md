# million-song
This is a Recommender System educational project attempting to solve the (completed) Million Song Dataset challenge in kaggle. The challenge is closed long time ago and the purpose of this project is to simply practice working on recommender systems. The initial plan is to implement the winner's solution and hopefully improve it through using a better similarity metric
